# Intro-to-R-for-Bench-Biologists
all the course materials for the introduction to R for bench biologists class at the Ellison Institute

---

# Workshop description 
 This 6 hr six week course is a brief introduction to the R statistical computing language designed specifically with bench biologists with no coding experience in mind so that they can get more done in less time and with less pain. This course is intended to be very hands-on and will include a final project of each individuals choosing, demonstrating the skills they have learned. There will be a brief introduction to programming principals, R and R studio, version control to make sure the students have the tools to use R effectively. We will cover importing data and common manipulations of data and data processing. The end of the course will cover data visualization both theory and practice.

# Final Project

> I find that R is learned best when you use it on your own data and when you need to use it. To help you learn and really interalize this content I'm "assigning" a final project. Its very open ended and I want you to use R in one of your analyses for your project. you can do a new analysis or reproduce one that you did in excel. Other than that there is no requirement. I don't want to you to spend a lot of time on this, rather the goal is to see how you can use R to meet your everyday analysis needs. I would love to have everyone give a 10min or less walkthrough of their code.
